#Events
danish_elections.1.t:0 "Municipal Elections of 1937/8 - Sjaelland"
danish_elections.1.d:0 "Although the Folketing elections showed a strong electorate for the social democrats, they struggled particularly in the region of Sjaelland where it seems the conservatives hold the upper hand. But do they really?"
danish_elections.1.a:0 "Socialdemokratiet er det sejrherre!"
danish_elections.1.b:0 "Konservative Parti er det sejrherre!"

danish_elections.2.t:0 "Municipal Elections of 1937/8 - North Jutland"
danish_elections.2.d:0 "The social democrats have to thank the people of North Jutland for their past electoral victories as it seems a stronghold of theirs. It would surely be an upset if the conservatives were to take the region."

danish_elections.3.t:0 "Municipal Elections of 1937/8 - South Jutland"
danish_elections.3.d:0 "Within the Danish region of South Jutland screams a loud minority, the germans inhabiting Nordslesvig. The political representation for these screams is the Schleswigsche Partei, which has national socialist undertones and vague connections to the German NSDAP, thus being considered dangerous by the Danish majority inhabiting the region. Though of course the Danish resistance will be insignificant in comparison to the german dissent."
danish_elections.3.b:0 "Slesvigsk Parti er det sejrherre!"

christian_denmark.0.t:0 "Royal Coup in Denmark"
christian_denmark.0.d:0 "After the rising current of fascism and communism engulfed Denmark, its government struggled to overcome this extremism. There commonly raged street skirmishes between the Danish police, the DKP and the DNSAP. After the Danish SA marched on the parliament building King Christian X capitalized on the situation and dismissed the government and has, for now at least, assumed absolute control of Denmark. According to his public statements he has plans to harshly crackdown on any opposition. The Icelandic government has refused to comment for now."
christian_denmark.0.a:0 "The continued failures of democracy..."
christian_denmark.0.b:0 "A return to the middle ages."
christian_denmark.0.c:0 "The Danish Lion seems to rise again"
christian_denmark.0.e:0 "Der er et yndigt land!"

christian_denmark.1.t:0 "Anti-Monarchist Opposition forming"
christian_denmark.1.d:0 "With the recent takeover of his majesty King Christian X many groups of resistance have formed. May it be the fascists, communists or democrats all of them wish to tear Denmark down and prostitute it to the powers of europe. It is vital to smash these groups in due time before they destroy the fabric of the Danish nation even further."
christian_denmark.1.a:0 "Herlig vil Danmark være!"

christian_denmark.2.t:0 "Turmoil in Copenhagen"
christian_denmark.2.d:0 "The head of the personal union between Denmark and Iceland has assumed absolute control in Copenhagen and now asks for reassurences from Reyklavik that the effects of the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union of 1918 will not be altered by the recent political instability in Denmark. Troublingly however, recent rhetoric has suggested that our sovereign seeks to reign in Iceland and bring it under his personal control as he did with Denmark. Two options present themselves."
christian_denmark.2.a:0 "Declare the Republic of Iceland!"
christian_denmark.2.b:0 "The Act of Union still applies."

christian_denmark.3.t:0 "Proclamation of the Republic of Iceland"
christian_denmark.3.d:0 "The Icelandic Prime Minister [ICE.GetLeader] has declared a semi-presidential republic after hearing of the political turmoil in Copenhagen. This is a clear violation of the Danish-Icelandic Act of Union, signed in 1918 and the King is not yet ruling out military intervention. We shall see how the situation develops."
christian_denmark.3.a:0 "A daring, yet foolish move."

christian_denmark.4.t:0 "Iceland shows itself compliant"
christian_denmark.4.d:0 "The now former Icelandic Prime Minister stood before the Althing yesterday and asked the parliament to support him in the decision to sever all ties with Denmark and proclaim an illegitimate republic, with him of course at its head. Though it seems the legislative was sensible that day as they denied this outright treasonus request. We must now look towards the future of the union."
christian_denmark.4.a:0 "To further Danish-Icelandic cooperation."

christian_denmark.5.t:0 "Family Business"
christian_denmark.5.d:0 "The dissolution of Denmark-Norway in the 19th century was a true tragedy. The Norwegian parts of our realm were stripped away by the treacherous Swedes in the aftermath of the napoleonic wars and ever since then have our two nations walked seperatly. Luckily in 1905 the Swedish-Norwegian Union dissolved and the brother of his majesty King Christian X, Price Carl of Denmark was elected to the Norwegian throne. With royal authority restored in Denmark, we may be able help Norway free itself from parliamentarianism."
