So it is undeniable that we will have to follow the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe foreign minister has come forth with two proposals:\n1. We can accept the Treaty of Versailles and gradually repay our loans with our newfound economic prosperity. Eventually this would lead to us fully-integrated into the western, democratic world. We would still suffer the limitations on our armed forces, though.\n2. We could, through diplomacy and negotiation, gradually try to rid us of the entire treaty's terms and reestablish a strong military. This would come at the cost of not being able to gain the benefits of being a modern, western country with good relations to the French, British and Americans."
