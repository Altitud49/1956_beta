 persia.1.t:0 "Trans-Iranian Railway complete!"
 persia.1.d:0 "After 8 long years, and the construction of 1,394 kilometers of track, passing through difficult mountainous terrain, the Trans-Iranian Railway has finally been completed. It links [266.GetName] to Bandar Shâhpur on the coast in the South, and to Bandar Shah in Golestān in the North on the banks of the Caspian Sea.\n\n[PER.GetLeader] spoke today at the opening of the state rail station in [266.GetName], praising the work of the many laborers and contractors in developing Iran's foremost industrial and technological marvel, and declared that even more rail connections will be made posthaste. The project, which constituted a significant tax burden, cost the state a hefty 2.195 billion rial in just the last 2 years alone."
 persia.1.a:0 "Three cheers for trains."
 
 persia.2.t:0 "Rifles modernization efforts"
 persia.2.d:0 "In the expansion of our ground forces units, we have run against a problem procuring small arms. The newest weapon we have is a Mauser from Germany from the early 1920s - it's time we look for something new. The NRA in China have received units of a semi-automatic rifle from the [CZE.GetAdjective] company Československá zbrojovka."
 persia.2.a:0 "Yes, that ZH-29 is of interest. Contact [CZE.GetNameDef]."

 persia.3.t:0 "Czech contract comes through"
 persia.3.d:0 "Our delegation of officers of the Iranian Army have returned from Brno in [CZE.GetNameDef] - with an award for license of production and a shipment of the ZH-29 rifle."
 persia.3.a:0 "A toast to our new [CZE.GetAdjective] supplier."
 
 persia.4.t:0 "Meeting on agriculture policy"
 persia.4.d:0 "[PER.GetLeader] has summoned the cabinet today to discuss the incumbent administration's policy towards the agrarian peasants, which make up the vast majority of current employment in the Iranian economy, who primarily reside in more rural areas. They utilitze qanats - special canals to irrigate the tough soil in usually non-arable portions of the country.\n\nSuch a large peasantry would be a powerful force if tax liens were created to shift them to industrial sectors, and some in the cabinet advocate forcefully relocating farmers to population centers to facilitate industrial growth, and importing crops to make up the lost farm productivity. Other suggest we leave the system alone, and create different tax breaks to incentivize the construction of even more qanats."
 persia.4.a:0 "We will enact measures to support farmers in the budget."
 persia.4.b:0 "Redirect the peasants to industry, and import grain."
 
 persia.6.t:0 "Training aircraft arrive"
 persia.6.d:0 "Our request to the [ENG.GetAdjective] to supply us with a small supply of training aircraft has been approved. With these new light aircraft, an expansion of the Ghale Morghi Air Base and its' flying school (both in [266.GetName]) we are prepared to finally begin indigenous development of the Iranian air force."
 persia.6.a:0 "Get them in the air, now!"
