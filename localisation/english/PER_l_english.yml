 #### BALANCE OF POWER ####
 
 persia.balance.1.t:0 "Kashf-e Hijab"
 persia.balance.1.d:0 "Today, [PER.GetLeader] issued a decree from the royal palace. Effective immediately, all Islamic veils - including the headscarf (hijab) and chador - will be forbidden for citizens to wear in public. Additionally, many forms of traditional male clothing, such as robes, as well as the wearing of beards, will be prohibited in public. [PER.GetLeader]'s edict instead encourages the populace to adopt European forms of dress. Ostensibly, this move is to promote nation-building and solidarity across ethnic and religious lines, as well as increase the freedom of Iranian women.\n\nThis action taken by the Shah is only the latest in a series of what the Shi'a clerics are decrying as attacks on the Muslim faith. The devout in [PER.GetNameDef] are sure to receive the royal decree poorly."
 persia.balance.1.a:0 "A win for Iranian women."

 #### TRANS IRANIAN RAILWAY ####
 
 persia.railway.1.t:0 "The Trans-Iranian Railway"
 persia.railway.1.d:0 "The Trans-Iranian railway has been under construction for several years, and has made signifcant progress. Work is being done on several bridges in the North Alborz, as well as lines across flat lands in the province of [413.GetName]. Many miles have been finished, but we have many more yet to go..."
 persia.railway.1.a:0 "Let's get to work."
 
 persia.railway.2.t:0 "Completion of Alborz Mountains crossings"
 persia.railway.2.d:0 "Construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway is progressing steadily, both over and under steep terrain in the Alborz Mountains in the North of our country. Large arched viaducts have been and are being built to ford rivers and deep valleys. Many have been finished at the direction of foreign construction firms, such as the Danish Kampsax or the German "Konsortium für Bauausführungen in Persien" (formed from 3 individual firms). The pinnacle of these bridges is the Veresk Bridge, which crosses the Veresk Valley, and is among the tallest bridges in the world."
 persia.railway.2.a:0 "What fine masonry."
 
 persia.railway.3.t:0 "Trans-Iranian Railway complete!"
 persia.railway.3.d:0 "After many long years, and the construction of 1,394 kilometers of track, the Trans-Iranian Railway has finally been completed. The line passes though difficult mountainous terrain, requiring tunneling through a massive salt dome, and another tunnel that passed through a massive cavern requiring a bridge within the tunnel. It links [266.GetName] to Bandar Shâhpur on the coast in the South, and to Bandar Shah in Golestān in the North on the banks of the Caspian Sea.\n\n[PER.GetLeader] spoke today at the opening of the state rail station in [266.GetName], praising the work of the many laborers and contractors in developing Iran's foremost industrial and technological marvel, and declared that even more rail connections will be made posthaste. The project, which constituted a significant tax burden, cost the state a hefty 2.195 billion rial since January of 1936 alone."
 persia.railway.3.a:0 "Truly a marvel for the modern age."

 persia.2.d:0 "In the expansion of our ground forces units, we have run against a problem procuring small arms. The newest weapon we have is a Mauser from Germany from the early 1920s - it's time we look for something new.

 persia.4.t:0 "Agrarian policy direction"
 persia.4.d:0 "[PER.GetLeader] has summoned the cabinet today to discuss the incumbent administration's policy towards the agrarian peasants, which make up the vast majority of current employment in the Iranian economy, who primarily reside in more rural areas. They utilitze qanats - special canals to irrigate the tough soil in usually non-arable portions of the country.\n\nSuch a large peasantry would be a powerful force if tax liens were created to shift them to industrial sectors, and some in the cabinet advocate forcefully relocating farmers to population centers to facilitate industrial growth, and importing crops to make up the lost farm productivity. Other suggest we leave the system alone, and create different tax breaks to incentivize the construction of even more qanats."

It is now up to us to choose his successor - for which there are many candidates.\n\nThe most eminently qualified choice would be the veteran officer and ally of the Shah Karim Agha Khan Bouzarjomehri, a student of World War 1 military doctrine and theory. However, there are other, younger candidates which promote more radical ideas for the direction of the Artesh..."
