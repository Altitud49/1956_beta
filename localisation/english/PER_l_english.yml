 #### ANGLO SOVIET INVASION ####

 ## Invasion first event (ENG)
 persia.invasion.1.t:0 "Concerns about Iran's alignment"
 persia.invasion.1.desc:0 "The War Cabinet is growing increasingly concerned at rumors of the presence of German nationals in [PER.GetNameDef]. Recently, [PER.GetLeader] has offered the German airliner Lufthansa a business deal, and there is even speculation about potential Iranian-German military cooperation - a chilling thought when the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company provides a significant amount of oil to Britain./n/nAs such, members of our high command have begun to draft plans for a potential invasion of Iran, and have approached the government seeking the War Cabinet's approval."
 persia.invasion.1.a:0 "We will adopt this draft and proceed."
 persia.invasion.1.b:0 "That shan't be necessary."

 ## Invasion ask Soviet/notify Iran
 ## Soviet loc
 persia.invasion.2.t.a:0 "British request joint invasion of [PER.GetNameDef]"
 persia.invasion.2.desc.a:0 "[ENG.GetLeader]'s government in [ENG.GetNameDef] has proposed the idea to us of a joint Anglo-[SOV.GetAdjective] Invasion of Iran, to secure not only Iran's vast oil supply but also the Trans-Iranian Railway, across which the British can supply us with arms and equipment.\n\n[SOV.GetLeader]'s advisors have also raised the concept of expanding [SOV.GetAdjective] influence in Iran, which can hopefully be leveraged to gain concessions and also counter British expansion in the Middle East."
 ## Iranian loc
 persia.invasion.2.t.b:0 "Potential of a British invasion!"
 persia.invasion.2.desc.b:0 "As a result of growing pressure by [ENG.GetNameDef], some in our government and military are now concerned about the potential of a British invasion of [PER.GetNameDef]. [PER.GetLeader] has been conciliatory towards British and [SOV.GetAdjective] diplomatic pressure in recent months, and had hoped to balance foreign interests and avoid entering the global conflict, but the Shah is facing the possibility that a growing consensus is building that is expecting an invasion."
 persia.invasion.2.a:0 "We must make ready."
 persia.invasion.2.b:0 "We will join this effort."
 persia.invasion.2.c:0 "Our forces are spread too thin already, we cannot."

 ## Soviets join the plan
 persia.invasion.3.t:0 "Soviets join the invasion"
 persia.invasion.3.desc:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has decided to join the plan to invade [PER.GetNameDef]. [SOV.GetLeader] may indeed have strategic interest in Iran's containment."
 persia.invasion.3.a:0 "Damn, now a strike on two fronts!"
 persia.invasion.3.b:0 "Cheers to the Great Bear."

 ## White peace event ask
 persia.invasion.4.t:0 "Iranian defense collapses, rumors of surrender"
 persia.invasion.4.desc:0 "To the shock of the Shah and the Artesh Command, the modernized and rebuilt Ground Forces have suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of the British and [SOV.GetAdjective] armies. A swift and decisive action, as well as continuous air raids on civilian targets causing hundreds of citizen casualties, has sent a decisive message to [PER.GetNameDef]: 'You will yield, or you will be destroyed.'\n\nIn light of this, as well as the apparent cowardice of low-ranking colonels, several figures in the government have asked to Shah to consider a full surrender to the invaders..."
 persia.invasion.4.a:0 "We have no choice - the nation must survive."
 persia.invasion.4.b:0 "No surrender! Every Iranian will resist until death!"
 persia.invasion.4.c:0 "We have no choice - the nation must survive."
 persia.invasion.4.d:0 "No surrender! Every Iranian will resist until death!"
 persia.invasion.4.e:0 "We have no choice - the nation must survive."
 persia.invasion.4.f:0 "No surrender! Every Iranian will resist until death!"

 ## Invasion soon to begin
 persia.invasion.5.t:0 "Invasion of Iran imminent!"
 persia.invasion.5.desc:0 "After some diplomatic exchanges between [PER.GetNameDefCap] and the Allied powers, the Shah has refused to completely expel any German nationals residing inside Iran.\n\nWith this declaration (amongst other demands rejected) it is obvious that the Allies are to proceed with military action."
 persia.invasion.5.a:0 "We must prepare!"

 ## invasion begins!
 persia.invasion.6.t:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] and [SOV.GetAdjective]s invade!"
 persia.invasion.6.desc:0 "Making good on their threats, the Allied powers have declared war upon and invaded our nation. Yet again, Iran is at war with foreign imperialists."
 persia.invasion.6.a:0 "Iran will resist, Jāved Iran!"

 ##### Occupation events

 persia.invasion.12.desc:0 "[SOV.GetAdjective] have captured the city of [419.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] after the swift execution of their battleplan in Northwestern Iran. Our forces attempted a defense, but a mixture of incompetence and unpreparedness resulted in defeat."
 persia.invasion.12.a:0 "Damn it!"

 persia.invasion.13.t:0 "Fall of [419.GetName]"
 persia.invasion.13.desc:0 "[ENG.GetAdjective] have captured the oil extraction facilities in Abadan in [413.GetName] after the swift execution of their battleplan. Our forces attempted a defense, but a mixture of incompetence and unpreparedness resulted in defeat."
 persia.invasion.13.a:0 "Damn it!"

 #### NEWS ####
 
 persia.news.1.t:0 "Anglo-[SOV.GetAdjective] Invasion of [PER.GetName]"
 persia.news.1.desc:0 "After weeks of planning, [ENG.GetNameDef] and [SOV.GetNameDef] have launched a joint military operation in [PER.GetName], with the aim of carrying out a swift occupation against an enemy outnumbered and technologically outmatched. According to [ENG.GetLeader], this operation will allow them to secure the [PER.GetAdjective] oil fields and [ENG.GetAdjective] supply lines to [SOV.GetNameDef], while also preventing a potential enemy advance from [TUR.GetNameDef] through [PER.GetName] towards the Baku oil fields and [RAJ.GetNameDef]."
 persia.news.1.a:0 "It is a necessary measure."
 persia.news.1.b:0 "Another victim of [ENG.GetLeader] and [SOV.GetLeader]."
 persia.news.1.c:0 "Not a fair fight..."

 persia.news.2.t:0 "Abdication of Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran"
 persia.news.2.t:0 "After weeks of frustration and internal instability after the recent Allied invasion of Iran - including the Shah replacing the Prime Minister - an agreement has finally formalized peace for [PER.GetNameDef]. Whilst the [ENG.GetAdjective] wished to reinstate the Qajars, the current Qajar heir is a British citizen that speaks no Persian.\n\nThus, a compromise emerged, from discussions amongst top officials and the Iranian elite, for Reza Shah to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The young Prince now finds himself at the head of a nation with resurgent economic hardship and under crippling foreign occuption."
 persia.news.2.t:0 "We wish for his success."
 
 #### BALANCE OF POWER ####
 
 persia.balance.1.t:0 "Kashf-e Hijab"
 persia.balance.1.d:0 "Today, [PER.GetLeader] issued a decree from the royal palace. Effective immediately, all Islamic veils - including the headscarf (hijab) and chador - will be forbidden for citizens to wear in public. Additionally, many forms of traditional male clothing, such as robes, as well as the wearing of beards, will be prohibited in public. [PER.GetLeader]'s edict instead encourages the populace to adopt European forms of dress. Ostensibly, this move is to promote nation-building and solidarity across ethnic and religious lines, as well as increase the freedom of Iranian women.\n\nThis action taken by the Shah is only the latest in a series of what the Shi'a clerics are decrying as attacks on the Muslim faith. The devout in [PER.GetNameDef] are sure to receive the royal decree poorly."
 persia.balance.1.a:0 "A win for Iranian women."

 persia.balance.2.t:0 "Clerics denounce government policy"
 persia.balance.2.d:0 "With [PER.GetLeader]'s decision to further commit to the secularisation of the Iranian state, clerical establishment figures, such as the venerable constitutionalist Sayyed Hassan Modarres - and others - have taken to outspoken criticism of the government. They have spoken about organizing rallies against the ruling class, but so far, this has just been rhetoric."
 persia.balance.2.a:0 "They can grumble all they want."
 persia.balance.2.b:0 "There will not be rallies. Arrest Modarres!"

 persia.balance.3.t:0 "Clerical establishment organizes resistance"
 persia.balance.3.d:0 "blah"
 persia.balance.3.a:0 "The Clerics are an obstacle, nothing more."

 persia.balance.4.t:0 "Pro-Islam riots and resistance escalates"
 persia.balance.4.d:0 "blah"
 persia.balance.4.a:0 "Send in the military!"

 persia.balance.5.t:0 "Mullahs denounce policy as anticlerical"
 persia.balance.5.d:0 "blah"
 persia.balance.5.a:0 "Damn those clerics!"

 persia.balance.6.t:0 "Clerics incite protests against the Shah"
 persia.balance.6.d:0 "blah"
 persia.balance.6.a:0 "Send in the police."

 persia.balance.7.t:0 "Riots against the Shah's regime!"
 persia.balance.7.d:0 "blah"
 persia.balance.7.a:0 "Clear them out with the military!"

 #### FOREIGN INFLUENCE ####

 persia.influence.1.t:0 "Appointing a Foreign Minister"
 persia.influence.1.desc:0 "It has come time to reorient [PER.GetNameDef]'s foreign diplomatic priorities. Today, [PER.GetLeader] has asked for the resignation of the Foreign Minister and initiated a significant shuffle of top Foreign Ministry staff.\n\nThe question now becomes about who would be best for the job in the future."
 persia.influence.1.a:0 "The job should go to Mozaffar Alam."
 persia.influence.1.b:0 "Ali Soheili has proven merit in foreign affairs."
 persia.influence.1.c:0 "We will go with Hossein Ala'. He has experience."

 persia.railway.1.d:0 "The Trans-Iranian railway has been under construction for several years, and has made signifcant progress. Work is being done on several bridges in the North Alborz, as well as lines across flat lands in the province of [413.GetName]. Many miles have been finished, but we have many more yet to go..."
 persia.railway.1.a:0 "Let's get to work."
 
 persia.railway.2.t:0 "Completion of Alborz Mountains crossings"
 persia.railway.2.d:0 "Construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway is progressing steadily, both over and under steep terrain in the Alborz Mountains in the North of our country. Large arched viaducts have been and are being built to ford rivers and deep valleys. Many have been finished at the direction of foreign construction firms, such as the Danish Kampsax or the German "Konsortium für Bauausführungen in Persien" (formed from 3 individual firms). The pinnacle of these bridges is the Veresk Bridge, which crosses the Veresk Valley, and is among the tallest bridges in the world."
 persia.railway.2.a:0 "What fine masonry."
 
 persia.railway.3.t:0 "Trans-Iranian Railway complete!"
 persia.railway.3.d:0 "After many long years, and the construction of 1,394 kilometers of track, the Trans-Iranian Railway has finally been completed. The line passes though difficult mountainous terrain, requiring tunneling through a massive salt dome, and another tunnel that passed through a massive cavern requiring a bridge within the tunnel. It links [266.GetName] to Bandar Shâhpur on the coast in the South, and to Bandar Shah in Golestān in the North on the banks of the Caspian Sea.\n\n[PER.GetLeader] spoke today at the opening of the state rail station in [266.GetName], praising the work of the many laborers and contractors in developing Iran's foremost industrial and technological marvel, and declared that even more rail connections will be made posthaste. The project, which constituted a significant tax burden, cost the state a hefty 2.195 billion rial since January of 1936 alone."
 persia.railway.3.a:0 "Truly a marvel for the modern age."
 
 #### NON-UNIQUE NAMESPACE EVENTS ####
 
 persia.5.t:0 "Appoint a new Chief of Army Staff"
 persia.5.d:0 "Azizollah Zarghami, the current Chief of Army Staff for the Iranian government, is retiring at the behest of [PER.GetLeader], with the goal of bringing new blood to our High Command. It is now up to us to choose his successor - for which there are many candidates.\n\nThe most eminently qualified choice would be the veteran officer and ally of the Shah Karim Agha Khan Bouzarjomehri, a student of World War 1 military doctrine and theory. However, there are other, younger candidates which promote more radical ideas for the direction of the Artesh..."
 persia.5.a:0 "The safe choice - General Bouzarjomehri."

 persia.10.t:0 "Literacy rate hits new high"
 persia.10.desc:0 "Thanks to new government policy strongly increasing access to education, and encouraging literacy, the literacy rate inside [PER.GetNameDef] has increased massively.

 persia.10.a:0 "A sign of modernity."

 persia.11.t:0 "Reza Shah contemplates abdication"
 persia.11.desc:0 "Weeks of frustration on behalf of Reza Shah have resulted in the caning and near-shooting of a senior I.I.A.F. officer, the replacement of the Prime Minister, and backroom talks with [ENG.GetNameDef] over potential peace terms - and the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, unmired by controversy, taking a central role in proceedings.\n\nMohammad Reza, with the help of Mohammad Ali Foroughi, the journalists of the Ardeshir Reporter, and other Iranian elites has drafted decree for the aging Shah to sign - one that proclaims his abdication, and the ascendance of his son to the Sun Throne."
 persia.11.a:0 "All in the sake of peace with Britain."
