During recent military exercises, the military French and British attachés present have noticed and pointed out Živković's lack of modern military knowledge and way of thinking. Živković, being the leader of the 'Bela Ruka', a secret military society loyal to the King, has become a key figure within the military with over 90% of the army supporting him, this makes him hardly replaceable. Thus, we are faced with a dilemma, either we implement the guidelines of the French and thus begin modernizing our military, as Živković's presence has incapacitated our modernization effort, or we maintain the status quo and the will of the people."

Many agree that the [YUG.GetAdjective] Army still lacks modern equipment, with some regiments lacking even the most basic military equipment. The tactics and strategies implemented in the exercises have not improved much since the Great War, with the Serbian-dominated staff being ever more conservative and content with current, yet outdated, military tactics. However, if we utilize these reports, we can implement the proposed reforms and start modernizing our military."
