mongol.20.d:0 "The dispatched squadron has effectively penetrated the enemy defensive perimeter and facing little to no opposition, has managed to infiltrate the local viallge disguised as a local militia,  seize some of the ill-guarded weapons from local storages, load those on horses and disappear in the dark without raising any alarm or harming civilians in the area. \n\nHeading back to the base, our soldiers have reported of some weapons variations which can be used to improve our own designs - a very welcome addition to use for the next raid."
mongol.20.a:0 "Bring in the tropheys and study them!"

mongol.21.t:0 "Small raid failed"
mongol.21.d:0 "The offensive party has moved out as planned and meeting no resistance, has successfully crossed the disputed border, aiming to reach the local settlement before the sunrise, when suddenly our forces were ambushed by an unknown striking force. A well-executed trap seems to be prepared in advance, as if every step of our forces was anticipated. \n\nOur troops managed to establish a safe passage and rapidly retreat into our homelands. Some are wounded while many have lost their weapons, and even more of them feeling demoralized by the seemingly superior enemy."
mongol.21.a:0 "Our soldiers morale is broken..."

mongol.22.t:0 "Offensive halted"
mongol.22.d:0 "A movement of some sort was spotted on the horizon as our raiding party has advanced into the enemy lands. A few hours later our brigade was met with an advancing enemy party with short exchange turned into the heated battle after some shots were fired by impatient soldiers on both sides. \n\nThe fire exchange lasted for a few hours with both parties retreating to their headquarters to reorganize, regain strength and refill the ammunition. The objective of the operation was unfortunately not met, yet some executed tactics and maneuvers allowed us to gain a valuable experience out of it."
mongol.22.a:0 "Very well. Our troops have learned a valuable lesson."

mongol.23.t:0 "Small raid repelled"
mongol.23.d:0 "Rapid mobilization of our reserves and fast dispatch of the forces has prevented a potential disaster from happening. \nAs advancing [MON.getAdjective] troops moved deeped into our territory, vigilant border regiments followed them and observed the situation from afar while regular troops prepared a battleground for those unsuspecting bandits. \n\nRight before the planned main engagement could began, one of our impulsive commanders has ordered the troops to engage the enemy, leaving other parties to follow the rapid advance and thus allowing the raiders to escape the probably encirclment and disappear in the dark, leaving however many guns behind which we can use to our advantage."
mongol.23.a:0 "A victory for our people!"

mongol.24.t:0 "Small [MON.GetAdjective] party raided our borders"
mongol.24.d:0 "Earlier this day a border patrol party has discovered traces of an apparent enemy squadron which crossed our border not later than a few days ago. Footprints and horseshoe traces suggest that the hostile team consisted of a few dozen light-armed man accompanied by a cavalry regiment, followed the road leading to the local ammunition storage, successfully pacified unsuspecting guards and left the following night, taking most of the present ammunition from the facility. \n\nThe rumour of "Ghost Riders" has already begin to spread among the local population. A small police garrison is to be dispatched into the contested area to oversight the region protection for the next few weeks."
mongol.24.a:0 "We have lost few valuable men and assets!"

mongol.25.t:0 "Stalemate Achieved"
mongol.25.d:0 "An enemy raiding party was spotted by a few observable peasants who immediately delivered the worrying message to the captain of the local police squadron who dispatched a "meeting delegation" to the contested area, aiming to slow down the advance of the enemy. \n\nFollowing the short round of negotiations, both parties opened fire claiming to be the one who only seek to defend their interests and eliminate the rising threat from the other side. The fighting continued until the darkness, as the enemy has gathered the remaining forces and retreated leaving our soldiers to heal the wounds and learn from this engagement."
mongol.25.a:0 "Very well. Our troops have learned a valuable lesson."

#medium-sized-raids
mongol.26.t:0 "Medium Raid Successfull"
mongol.26.d:0 "Few weeks of intense planning and careful preparations have paid off, for a few of our divisions have breached the enemy border in multiple locations to later meet together and overcome local garrison guarding military base, infiltrate the munition warehouses and retreive multiple variants of modern military equipment for our use. \n\nAfter the alert went off, our squadrons concealed the obtained tools and safely transferred them to our side of the border across the well-established and protected corridors. Local commander has excitingly reported that new pieces can be used to equip our troops or utilized for the scientific purposes."
mongol.26.a:0 "More equipment to use! Wonderful!"
mongol.26.b:0 "Very well. Use them for testing."

mongol.27.t:0 "Medium Raid Repelled"
mongol.27.d:0 "Rapid and somewhat reckless advance of our armed forces was intercepted by the enemy border security patrol, who immediately opened fire on sight with our troops retaining the higher ground while trying to establish a solidified defensive position and restructure formations for the renewed advance before the enemy's reinforcements arrive to the disputed area. \n\nThe enemy appeared to be well-aware of our tactics, since before our counterattack could begun, a flanking maneuver was conducted by enemy cavalry regiment, reigning chaos on ill-defended flanks and eliminating a part of our forces in the close combat, giving the rest of the intrusion team to gather shocked survivors, estabhlish a bridgehead to our homelands and retreat as the night settled in."
mongol.27.a:0 "Many mothers will miss their sons today..."

mongol.28.t:0 "Raiding Party Advance Delayed"
mongol.28.d:0 "First stage of the operation was conducted according to the initial procedure at most areas of interest with one single yet vital exceptional case. The regiment was expected to advance into one of the fortified enemy positions and cut down the communication lines, giving the rest of out forces the necessary time to infiltrate the disputed area without too much trouble. \n\nYet the red alert was raised after a jammed rifle of one of our soldiers fired seemingly arbitrary shot, forcing the enemy into close-up fight with our troops. The window of opportunity has passed and without a signal to continue, the remaining forces had to retreat into initial positions while the already entrenched squadron has successfully evacuated the entirety of the military contingent to report back to the command of the occured misfortune."
mongol.28.a:0 "Improve our regiments."
mongol.28.b:0 "Good. Think of another tactic to learn."

mongol.29.t:0 "Medium Raid Destroyed"
mongol.29.d:0 "Naive enemy invaders thought that they can move into our lands on their behalf and threat our people in those pesky attacks on civilian and military targets! For border security patrols have reported of the successfull destruction of the enemy raiding party aimed to steal and plunder our lands! \n\nEnemy advances were detected and their party intercepted in the area where strategic advantage was on our side, allowing a brave cavalry squadron to ourflank the enemy and strike into the heart of this pest, forcing the remains of the bandits to retreat from where they came from. Tropheys are being handed to the soldiers while local commander gains another medal!"
mongol.29.a:0 "We are proud of our militia and military!"

mongol.30.t:0 "[MON.GetAdjective] Divisions Raided our Munition Storage"
mongol.30.d:0 "After the local garrison of the borderland military base failed to respond via the usual communication routine, full mobilization of the armed forces in the region was announced and martial law was issued before the panic could spread among the population. \n\nOnly a few hous later, as the rapidly advancing cavalry has reached the positions, the whole horror of enemys doings was seen, with entire installation missing not only production material, but also machines and recently produced and stored equipment. With such heavy damage done for the economy and military capabilities, it is vital to ensure that nothing like this will happen in the future. "
mongol.30.a:0 "We will have much to rebuild from now on"

mongol.31.t:0 "Raid Party Intercepted"
mongol.31.d:0 "One of our fortified regions has raised a global alarm after an infiltrating enemy squadron fired a shot of unknown nature. Anyway, soldiers were dispatched at positions trying to force the enemy out of well-established entrenched defensive battlelines. \n\nThe fighting continued for a few more hours and with no side clearly getting an advantage, the enemy has retreated leaving the local garrison to question possible motives of such reckless raid. Other border patrols reported some increase in enemy acitivity in their areas of interest as well."
mongol.31.a:0 "We are always ready to repell their advances!"
mongol.31.b:0 "Great! Learn from the enemy."

####################### POLITICAL EVENTS ####################

mongol.35.t:0 "Dealing with Genden"
mongol.35.d:0 "At the recent Great Khural Assembly the protocols of our diplomatic mission were presented to the public, revealing the whole controversy surrounding the talks and negotiation tactics of some delegation members. \n\nOne of the names was mentioned more often than others, and it is the former prime minister Peljidiin Genden. While some see his behaviour as the sign of iron will and strong unruliness, other see his provocative manners as a lack of skills, education and cleverness, implying that such person cannot retain a high political office in the future. \n\nWe have various options at our disposal, what shall the decision of wise [MON.getLeader] be?"
mongol.35.a:0 "Allow him to remain in office as a foreign minister."
mongol.35.b:0 "Force him into early retirement."
mongol.35.c:0 "Such behaviour cannot be tolerated, arrest, or even better, assassinate him!"

The incident is a very unfortunate turn of event for our country, but perhaps a fortunate one for someone else? We shall see..."
mongol.36.a:0 "A suspicious conincidence?!"

#Choibalsan plot
mongol.37.t:0 "Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir Raises his Concerns"
mongol.37.d:0 "One of the leaders of the left opposition, Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, has arrived in the office of [MON.getLeader] this evening after the end of the working day to discuss the "very urgent matter". \n\nEnlightend by the table lamp in the office, Eldev-Ochir quietly spoke of that many of the party elite now in fear of their life considering the rapid changes in the political climate of the country. He also metioned that if Choibalsan obtains another military or governmental promotion, his iron grip over the country combined with his contacts in the NKVD might engulf the land into another decade of political violence, which shall be prevented."
mongol.37.a:0 "Choibalsan is too dangerous, let us prepare an insurrection."
mongol.37.b:0 "Assure him that everything is fine."

mongol.38.t:0 "Leftists Seize Power!"
mongol.38.d:0 "The morning session of the States Khural was interrupted by the crowd which gathered in front of the building to demonstrate against the recently passed legislations, claiming that those are only in interest for the governmental elite, but not for a common men and women, The parliamentary guard was then hastily reinforced to prevent further interruptions into the lawmaking processes. \n\nAfter a few hours of shouting, the crowd let their ringleaders to step forward and announce to the guards that those sitting in the parliaentary building act in their own personal interests and not the interests of the masses, showcasing the evidence of governmental corruption. And while the guards were distracted, a few armed men managed to sneak undetected into the building, cut the building communications and dismiss the parliamentary session, followed by the ceremonial procedure where [MON.getLeader] has resigned from his prime-minister position and transferred his powers to the "provisional" minister Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir."
mongol.38.a:0 "It is for the greater good"

mongol.39.t:0 "Choibalsan Launches a Coup!"
mongol.39.d:0 "Despite the officials announcement of the State Little Khural that the countrys political course shall again lean to the left for the next five years, a sizeble part of the rural population under the guidance of pro-[SOV.getAdjective] elements organized massive demonstrations cross country. Clashing with the police, some of the protesters obtained firearms and started raiding ill-defended munition storages around the country, allegebly aiming to establish irregular militia formation to fight the rightful regime! \n\nWe cannot allow some militans to suppress the free will of the people by force, for the time has come to restore the order into the lands we are destined to rule!"
mongol.39.a:0 "To arms!"

Extreme division of a party has lead to rightists capitalistic reforms of 1926-1928 and to devastation caused by the far-leftist approach to collectivization of 1928-1932. \n\nDrastic government changes are having a negative impact on lifes of our people. Constant shift of political compass might be explained by many factors, yet the main reason is clear: our party is infiltrated by the foreign agents and collaborators of [JAP.GetNameDef] or [CHI.GetNameDef].

Luckily, we already have an experience with limiting llama's power since Choibalsan rise to power. \n\nStaying loyal to the [SOV.GetAdjective]s, their leader [SOV.GetLeader] and principles of communism implies that we shall conduct this operation as soon as possible."
