Your prior knowledge might depend heavily on your previous working experience and aimag you were assigned to. The overall situation can be briefly described as follows:\n\nOur lands are still viewed as an integral part of [CHI.getNameDef] even though their leadership have little to no effective power in the region. \n[JAP.getAdjective] imperialists have been constantly increasing their acitivity in Eastern regions of our nation after seezing assets of Fengtian clique in 1932. \nThe one and only friend in such circumstances was the USSR which provided us with ideological and material assistance since people's revolution of 1924, strongly solidifying their influence in our state.\n\nWith Genden and Demid being currently on their visit to Moscow, we can send a few offerings via the telegraph on what additional topics they should address on the conference. Time is limited and every hours counts! \n\nI will leave you to prepare. Zövlökh out."
