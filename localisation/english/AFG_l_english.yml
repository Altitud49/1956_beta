According to its statute, the heads of the country together with the tribal leaders hold an annual meeting of the Loya Jirga to discuss the country's path during these unsettling times. \n\nThis year's Jirga is expected to focus primarily on the social status of women, Kabul's industrialization and recently introduced school reforms, and the foreign policy of the nation. The King accompanied by his cabinet members is expected to arrive in a few hours. We received information that some of the Nimruz and Farah farmers are unhappy with supplies redistribution, while the Northerners from Takhar are concerned about the recent Basmachi raids in their heartlands. Some of the army members are also expected to voice their dissatisfaction with the current modernization plan. On the other side, we anticipate to receive an overwhelming ammount of support from Kabul where the first ever university in the country was just recently opened.\n\nThe King was advised to take a firm stance on the matter of the army, but be ready to provide some concessions if discussion becomes too heated. All in all, we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the 1928 Loya Jirga."
