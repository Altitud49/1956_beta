 #DECISIONS

 JOR_tribes_desc:0 "Our recently established political structure includes a reigning monarch and a council of tribal representatives that hold the country together and further unify our peoples, however this makes any efforts from the Emir at gaining political support or strengthening his rule difficult, to add on to this, the tribes also follow a form of strong conservatism, slowing down jordan's modernization projects of the army, industry or foreign policy, which has been supported by the people, any shift from this system may cause future problems. \n\n\Howitat: [JORGetHowitat]\nAl-Utaybah: [JORGetUtaybah]\nBani Sakhr: [JORGetBaniSakhr]\nBani Hamida: [JORGetBaniHamida]\n\n\n§WTotal Tribal Support is: §Y[?JOR_tribal_support]%"

 jordan.1.a:0 "Long Live Abdullah!"

 jordan.2.t:0 "Appeasement of the Tribal Council"
 jordan.2.d:0 "Following the heated arguement between Emir Abdullah and his advisors in Amman, the Emir has went out and publically denounced any accusations of not following the emirate's strong unifying tribal councils, and has embraced tribal support, he has also issued an apology and compensation to the Utaybah tribe to soften up wounds made from the Sultan Adwan rebellion."
 jordan.2.a:0 "We must stomp out infighting!"

 jordan.3.t:0 "Transjordan Requests Independance"
 jordan.3.d:0 "The Treaty which was agreed upon by the Transjordanian Emir and the British High Commissioners in 1929 has been widely hated within the Transjordanian People, and now the Emir is asking for greater autonomy and independence from the British if they are to peacefully transition from our protectorate to an independant state, we might be able to lessen the burden of governing the middle eastern areas."
 jordan.3.a:0 "No, we will not grant the Emir his wish."
 jordan.3.b:0 "It might be more benifitial."

 jordan.4.t:0 "Britain Denies Independance"
 jordan.4.d:0 "Following our daring diplomatic effort at gaining independence, the british have decided to decline it, and offer no concessions to the 1929 treaty, this has upset many of the already unsupportive Transjordanian people, the Emir must act."
 jordan.4.a:0 "They do not control us!"
 jordan.4.b:0 "We must back down, for the good of the Transjordanian People."

 jordan.5.t:0 "Transjordan's Independance"
 jordan.5.d:0 "Our diplomat that was sent to negotiate for independence and a rewriting of the 1929 treaty has came back with great news, the british high commissioners have come to a conclusion where they have agreed to grant us independence from our protectorate status if we are to keep political ties, and not to disturb any existing british advisors."
 jordan.5.a:0 "Lan Tasqut Al Urdun!"
