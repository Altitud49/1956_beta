 #DECISIONS

 JOR_tribes_desc:0 "Our recently established political structure includes a reigning monarch and a council of tribal representatives that hold the country together and further unify our peoples, however this makes any efforts from the Emir at gaining political support or strengthening his rule difficult, to add on to this, the tribes also follow a form of strong conservatism, slowing down jordan's modernization projects of the army, industry or foreign policy, which has been supported by the people, any shift from this system may cause future problems. \n\n\Howitat: [JORGetHowitat]!\nAl-Utaybah: [JORGetUtaybah]!\nBani Sakhr: [JORGetBaniSakhr]!\nBani Hamida: [JORGetBaniHamida]\n\n\n§WTotal Tribal Support is: §Y[?JOR_tribal_support]%"
