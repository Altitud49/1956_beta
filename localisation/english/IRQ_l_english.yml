This came in response to [IRQ.GetAdjective] provocations at the RAF Habbaniya airbase, which [IRQ.GetAdjective] forces have surrounded.\n\nIraqi officials have accused the British of violating the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty, whilst British diplomats have pressed the case against [GER.GetFactionName] influence in Iraq, and denounced [IRQ.GetLeader] and his Arab nationalist allies."
