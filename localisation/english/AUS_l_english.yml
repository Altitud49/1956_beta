  AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The First Republic is over. On the 20th of May 1933, in an enabling act eerily similiar to the one Adolf Hitler had used to take power in Germany just a couple months beforehand, Chancellor Engelbert Dolfuss proclaimed the Federal State of Austria, turning the once free and democratic republic into a fascist dicatorship.\nThe following year would bring two civil wars, one with the socialists, and one with the Nazis, which would end with the assasination of Dolfuss.\nNow, Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg finds himself steering an unstable nation into a brewing storm, and faced with a choice - choose a path, or face sure destruction."

During the bloody coup that was launched on the 25th of July, the entire federal army was mobilized to fight the SS troops, eventually managing to defeat them, however chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss was killed during the fighting, leaving our new regime in a very vulnerable situation.\n\nAfter taking over following Dollfuss's death, Kurt Schuschnigg has avowed to make sure such an event will never happened again, however there are still supporters of the Nazis at large, heavily destabilizing our nation. We must make sure we suppress their efforts, or we could be faced with dire consequences.\n\n§RIf the Nazis were to gain control of 70% of our divisions, a civil war will break out!§!"

 #EVENT

 austria.0.t:0 "The Third Austrian Civil War"
 austria.0.d:0 "Ever since the July Putsch, many feared that the Nazi Party would once again try to strike at the government. Their fears have come true.\n\nEarlier today, army divisions all across the country that were rumored to have been secretly loyal to the Nazis have risen up against the government in support of the Nazi government in Germany. The government has rallied all remaining army units to it's side to try to stop them, but only time will tell if this will be successful."
 austria.0.a:0 "The traitors must be crushed!"
 austria.0.b:0 "Long live a German Austria!"


 austria.1.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland" 
 austria.1.d:0 "It was inevitable.\n\nEveryone knew the Treaty of Versailles would not last, but many were surprised to see it be broken so soon. This is of upmost importance to us, since the treaty is what keeps our state independent, even though a large portion of the populations of both Germany and Austria wish to see the two nations united.\n\nIf we are to keep our independence intact, we must look outwards, and fast, before the Nazis start to look outwards for places to expand their influence."
 austria.1.a:0 "Tick, Tock."

 austria.2.t:0 "Looking Outwards" 
 austria.2.d:0 "One must come to the realization that Austria cannot stand against Germany alone. If our nation is to keep our independence, we must look outwards for protection.\n\nThere are three options at hand:\n\nThe first option is to expand our existing alliance with [ITA.GetNameDef]. This seems like the logical choice, as the [ITA.GetAdjective]s already support our regime, and they would likely not come with demands from our government. However, some members of the government have rightfully raised that the [ITA.GetAdjective]s appear to be warming up to the Nazis in Germany, and they fear that they might abandon us for them if they see us as a burden to their relationship.\n\nOur second option is to enter negotiations with the western powers. Although we might not agree politically, Britain and France wish to keep Germany weak, and by protecting our independence they achieve that goal. However, they might come with demands regarding our administration, supporting us only if we agree to certain reforms.\n\nOur third and final option is to enter negotiation with Germany. Although this is opposed by Schuschnigg, some members of the government want to pressure him into negotiating with the Nazis, perhaps securing limited autonomy instead of full annexation by Germany.\n\nIt is time to choose. We cannot wait any longer."
 austria.2.a:0 "The Italians are our allies. They can be trusted."
 austria.2.b:0 "The Italians are too friendly with the Germans. Look west."
 austria.2.c:0 "We must accept the inevitable. Pressure Schuschnigg and enter negotiations."
 austria.2.e:0 "We are alone. God help us."

 austria.3.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Requests Protection"
 austria.3.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has come to us regarding the recent German remilitarization of the Rhineland. The [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership believe that after the Germans showed their blatant disregard for the Treaty of Versailles, it is only a matter of time before they try to integrate Austria into their realm, and as such they come to us looking for protection, as per our alliance.\n\nSome members of our government believe that we must not think twice about protecting Austria, our ally, while others say that the risk of ruining our relationship with the Germans is too high.\n\nWhat should be done?"
 austria.3.a:0 "They are our allies. Protect them."
 austria.3.b:0 "We cannot risk ruining our relationship with the Germans."
 
 austria.4.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Protect Us"
 austria.4.d:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] has agreed to protect us against the Germans, citing the great alliance between our Fascist nations. We can only hope this is enough to deter the Germans from getting any ideas."
 austria.4.a:0 "We can count on them."

 austria.5.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Protect Us"
 austria.5.d:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] has flat out refused to protect us against the Germans. It appears as if their desire for an alliance with them outweighs their current alliance with us."

 austria.6.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has come to us regarding the recent German remilitarization of the Rhineland. The [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership believe that after the Germans showed their blatant disregard for the Treaty of Versailles, it is only a matter of time before they try to integrate Austria into their realm, and as such they come to us looking for protection. As our goal is to keep Germany weak, this might be worth considering, although we should probably demand reforms to their government and the eventual restoration of free elections if they are to be protected by us."
 austria.6.a:0 "We will do it, but they must reform."
 austria.6.b:0 "This is not in our interests."

 austria.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Democratic Reforms"
 austria.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has expressed that [FROM.GetNameDef] is open to protecting us, however they demand in return that we must remove our restrictions on opposition parties and move towards holding free elections in the future. This demand has been deemed ridiculous by many members of the government, however, many see this alliance as our only chance to be protected by Germany.\n\nWith the country divided by this choice, Schuschnigg himself has floated the idea of proposing a moderate restoration of Otto Von Hapsburg as a unifying figure for the nation in these times, and he believes that the Allies are too desperate to weaken Germany to deny us this request.\n\nWhat will be our choice?"
 austria.7.a:0 "Accept the reforms. It is our only choice."
 austria.7.b:0 "Propose the Hapsburg Plan."
 austria.7.c:0 "No compromises! We will find someone else."

 austria.8.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDef] Accepts Our Demands"
 austria.8.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership has accepted our demands. We will protect them against the Germans, and they will begin democratic reforms. This is a great victory for us, as we have both weakened Germany and brought a new country into our sphere of influence."
 austria.8.a:0 "Very well."
 
 austria.9.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Hapsburg Compromise" 
 austria.9.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has returned to us with a compromise regarding our demands - Otto Von Hapsburg will be restored as a constitutional figurehead of a moderate Austrian Empire. Some members of government think this is ridiculous - we just fought a war against them not 20 years ago, However some believe that letting Austria slip away into Germany's grasp is too big a risk, and we should agree anyway."
 austria.9.a:0 "They can have their restoration."
 austria.9.b:0 "Our demands are clear."

 austria.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Hapsburg Compromise"

 austria.11.d:0 "[FROM.Adjective] delegates have flatly refused our compromise, citing that they will not support the restoration of the same empire they fought not 20 years ago.

 austria.13.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Requests Negotiations"
 austria.13.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has reached out to our government, claiming that it is increasingly obvious that we wish to incorporate them into our realm, and they wish to negotiate.\n\nThe [AUS.GetAdjective]s have proposed that Austria become an autonomous subject of Germany, and in turn we would not occupy them."
 austria.13.a:0 "We can accept this compromise, but a friendly government must take power."
 austria.13.b:0 "We have other plans for them."
 
 austria.14.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Demands Nazi Takeover"
 austria.14.d:0 "[GER.GetLeader] has agreed to our request to become an autonomous subject, however he demands that we must install a government friendly to the Nazi regime, which would mean the takeover of the Austrian Nazis."
 austria.14.a:0 "Schuschnigg will not give up power so easily, but we can deal with him."
 austria.14.b:0 "Unnaceptable! We will find better allies!"
 
 austria.15.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 austria.15.d:0 "Austrian leadership has contacted us and promised the Schuschnigg will be dealt with as requested."
 austria.15.a:0 "We await to see it."

 austria.16.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"

 austria.16.a:0 "We will deal with them soon enough."

 austria.17.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Negotiations"
 austria.17.d:0 "Our attempts to negotiate with Germany have been ignored. We can only assume the worst is to come, and we must prepare for it."
 austria.17.a:0 "we must find someone to protect us."

 austria.18.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Recieves Foreign Protection"
 austria.18.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective]s, probably seeing our expansionist policies, have recieved foreign protection against any threats from us. This effectively puts a stop to our plans for an Anschluss, as it is not worth the risk to enter a war with any major countries at this point in time."
 austria.18.a:0 "Scrap our plans for the Anschluss"
 austria.18.b:0 "This will not stop us!"

 austria.19.t:0 "SDAPÖ Preimiereship"
 austria.19.d:0 "With the return of Otto Bauer from exile, many question who will lead the SDAPÖ in the current elections. Both Karl Renner and Otto Bauer led the party together during the time of the First Republic, but now with the looming threat from the Germans to our north, the two men have two different plans for Austria's future.\n\nWhile Renner believs that our best chance at surviving the coming storm is to dig in and fortify our country, Bauer's more idealistic perspective is that it is our duty to topple the totalitarian regime in Germany once and for all, as a final step to unite both our nations.\n\nWhich should the party choose?"
 austria.19.a:0 "Renner's plan is the only way we can survive."
 austria.19.b:0 "Bauer has the right spirit!"

 austria.20.t:0 "Return of the Kaiser"
 austria.20.d:0 "Today, under heavy pressure from both the western allies and his government, chancellor Schuschnigg announced over the radio that he would be stepping down to preserve the independence of the Austrian nation.\n\nIn his heartfelt speech, Schuschnigg proclaimed that due to the threat from the Germans, now was the time for unity and not division, and as such, Otto von Hapsburg would return from exile as a unifying figure to lead the Austrian people through these dark days.\n\nAlthough many see the is a triumphant victory and the return to old Austrian glory, the truth is that Otto returns to be nothing more than a figurehead of a deeply divided parliament.\n\nFor him, there is much work to be done."
 austria.20.a:0 "Long Live the Kaiser!"

 austria.21.t:0 "Otto Assumes the Austrian Crown"
 austria.21.d:0 "Today, in a heartfelt speech, chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg of Austria announced his resignation in preparation for the return of the Hapsburgs to the crown.\n\nAustria has been under pressure ever since the remilitarization of the Rhineland to find protection against the Germans, but such protections come at a cost. The western allies' pressure have effectively reduced Otto's new powers to nothing more than a figurehead position, much to the dismay of the new Kaiser. Many fear that Otto's quest for power will lead to further instability in the nation, but for now, the future of Austria is not yet clear."
 austria.21.a:0 "Could this further destabilize the continent?"
 austria.21.b:0 "There is much work to be done."

 austria.22.t:0 "A Fall from Grace"
 austria.22.d:0 "As the culmination of months of political manouvering between the parliament and the Kaiser, earlier today, several acts were passed in the parliament that further limit the powers of the Kaiser, effectively turning his already limited power into nothing more than a ceremonial position.\n\nThis effectively marks the end of the political struggle, as the SDAPÖ and their allies have become the dominant political force of the nation, sidelining both Otto and their conservative rivals.\n\nPerhaps the return of the Hapsburgs was not the return of old glories, but the start of new prosperities."
 austria.22.a:0 "A great victory for democracy."
 
 austria.23.t:0 "The Second Enabling Act"
 austria.23.d:0 "As the culmination of months of political manouvering between the parliament and the Kaiser, earlier today, government officials loyal to the Kaiser passed an enabling act granting Otto numerous powers that effectively make him the dominant political force in the country, with the parliament firmly under his influence.\n\nEerily similiar to Dolfuss's enabling act in 1934, many see this as the end of Austria being pushed around by other powers, and a return to old glories, but the consequences of this development could strain our relations with our allies and put us under threat."
 austria.23.a:0 "A great victory for our glory!"

 austria.24.t:0 "Cousins, Not Brothers?"
 austria.24.d:0 "Earlier today, [AUS.GetLeader] has come to us with an offer proposing an alliance between our nations. He states that it is foolish to not see that the former Austro-Hungarian empire was unstable and our rivalry led to it's decline, however our two great nations have both been humiliated following the Great War and we must ally together as partners to retake our lost glory.\n\nThis could be a great oppertunity to regain our lost territories once more. Do we accept?" 
 austria.24.a:0 "We shall go forward together."
 austria.24.b:0 "We've had enough of the Austrian's empty promises!"
 
 austria.25.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Accepts!"
 austria.25.d:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal for an alliance between our nations. This is a great day."
 austria.25.a:0 "Now we must look around us."

 austria.26.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Declines"
 austria.26.d:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] has declined our request, saying that the Hungarian people will have nothing more to do with us and our promises."
 austria.26.a:0 "They will grow to regret this."

 austria.27.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Offers Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 austria.27.d:0 "In accordance with our alliance, [AUS.GetLeader] has come to us with a proposal to reclaim our lost territory. He offers to partition the Czechoslovakian lands between us, with Austria getting Czechia and us getting Slovakia. Should we take the oppertunity?"
 austria.27.a:0 "We should move forward immediately."
 austria.27.b:0 "We have other things to worry about."

 austria.28.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Proposal"
 austria.28.d:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal to split Czechoslovakia between us."
 austria.28.a:0 "Let us proceed."

 austria.29.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Proposal"

 austria.29.a:0 "We cannot do it alone."
 austria.29.b:0 "We don't need their help."

 austria.30.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Demands Partition"
 austria.30.d:0 "It has happened. Ever since the return of the Hapsburgs to the throne in Austria, many were afraid of an invasion from a resurgent Austrian Empire.\n\nEarlier today, Austrian troops started massing on our border, and we were issued an ultimatum - let our nation be partitioned between it and it's allies, or war. We need to act fast."
 austria.30.a:0 "We have no choice..."
 austria.30.b:0 "Death Before Dishonor!"
 
 austria.31.t:0 "[CZE.GetNameDefCap] Defiant"
 austria.31.d:0 "The [CZE.GetAdjective] government has ignored our ultimatum and mobilized its army. [CZE.GetLeader] has promised that any invader would find the military more than prepared to defend the country to the last man."
 austria.31.a:0 "It means war."

 austria.32.t:0 "[CZE.GetNameDefCap] Surrenders"
 austria.32.d:0 "Wanting to avoid a destructive war between our nations, the [CZE.GetAdjective] government has stepped down and allowed our forces to take over. Today is a great day for Austria."
 austria.32.a:0 "As they should."

 austria.33.t:0 "Collapse of the League of Nations"
 austria.33.d:0 "The League of Nations has collapsed, and as such, our reliance on international loans has put us in a position where we do not have enough funding without them to support our expenses. Our economy is slowing to a halt, and all we can do is wait and restart it once we have gathered enough funds on our own."
 austria.33.a:0 "Not good." 

 austria.34.t:0 "Return of the Kaiser"
 austria.34.d:0 "Today, under heavy pressure from his government, chancellor Schuschnigg announced over the radio that he would be stepping down to preserve the independence of the Austrian nation.\n\nIn his heartfelt speech, Schuschnigg proclaimed that due to the threat from the Germans, now was the time for unity and not division, and as such, Otto von Hapsburg would return from exile as a unifying figure to lead the Austrian people through these dark days.\n\nAlthough many see the is a triumphant victory and the return to old Austrian glory, the truth is that Otto returns to be a leader of a nation who's very existance is under threat.\n\nFor him, there is much work to be done."
 austria.34.a:0 "Long Live the Kaiser!"

 austria.35.t:0 "Otto Assumes the Austrian Crown"
 austria.35.d:0 "Ever since the remilitarization of the Rhineland, many have wondered what the fate of the Austrian state would be. Many knew that Schuschnigg was planning to resign in face of the German threat, however not many expect it to be like this.\n\nToday, in a heartfelt speech, chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg of Austria announced his resignation in preparation for the return of the Hapsburgs to the crown. Newly crowned Otto von Hapsburg has already addressed the nation, stating that there is much work to be done, but the legacy of greatness for Austria is not a thing of the past.\n\nWhatever the future of Europe might be, Otto's speech has sent shockwaves throughout the entire European continent."
