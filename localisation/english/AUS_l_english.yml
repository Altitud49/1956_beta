During the bloody coup that was launched on the 25th of July, the entire federal army was mobilized to fight the SS troops, eventually managing to defeat them, however Dollfuss was killed during the fighting, leaving our new regime in a very vulnerable situation.\n\nAfter taking over following Dollfuss's death, Kurt Schuschnigg has avowed to make sure such an event will never happened again, however there are still supporters of the Nazis at large, heavily destabilizing our nation."

 #EVENT

 austria.1.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland" 
 austria.1.d:0 "It was inevitable.\n\nEveryone knew the Treaty of Versailles would not last, but many were surprised to see it be broken so soon. This is of upmost importance to us, since the treaty is what keeps our state independent, even though a large portion of the populations of both Germany and Austria wish to see the two nations united.\n\nIf we are to keep our independence intact, we must look outwards, and fast, before the Nazis start to look outwards for places to expand their influence."
 austria.1.a:0 "We must act."

 austria.2.t:0 "Looking Outwards" 
 austria.2.d:0 "One must come to the realization that Austria cannot stand against Germany alone. If our nation is to keep our independence, we must look outwards for protection.\n\nThere are three options at hand:\n\nThe first option is to expand our existing alliance with [ITA.GetNameDef]. This seems like the logical choice, as the [ITA.GetAdjective]s already support our regime, and they would likely not come with demands from our government. However, some members of the government have rightfully raised that the [ITA.GetAdjective]s appear to be warming up to the Nazis in Germany, and they fear that they might abandon us for them if they see us as a burden to their relationship.\n\nOur second option is to enter negotiations with the western powers. Although we might not agree politically, Britain and France wish to keep Germany weak, and by protecting our independence they achieve that goal. However, they might come with demands regarding our administration, supporting us only if we agree to certain reforms.\n\nOur third and final option is to enter negotiation with Germany. Although this is opposed by Schuschnigg, some members of the government want to pressure him into negotiating with the Nazis, perhaps securing limited autonomy instead of full annexation by Germany.\n\nIt is time to choose. We cannot wait any longer."
 austria.2.a:0 "The Italians are our allies. They can be trusted."
 austria.2.b:0 "The Italians are too friendly with the Germans. Look west."
 austria.2.c:0 "We must accept the inevitable. Pressure Schuschnigg and enter negotiations."
 austria.2.e:0 "We are alone. God help us."

 austria.3.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Requests Protection"
 austria.3.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has come to us regarding the recent German remilitarization of the Rhineland. The [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership believe that after the Germans showed their blatant disregard for the Treaty of Versailles, it is only a matter of time before they try to integrate Austria into their realm, and as such they come to us looking for protection, as per our alliance.\n\nSome members of our government believe that we must not think twice about protecting Austria, our ally, while others say that the risk of ruining our relationship with the Germans is too high.\n\nWhat should be done?"
 austria.3.a:0 "They are our allies. Protect them."
 austria.3.b:0 "We cannot risk ruining our relationship with the Germans."
 
 austria.4.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Protect Us"
 austria.4.d:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] has agreed to protect us against the Germans, citing the great alliance between our Fascist nations. We can only hope this is enough to deter the Germans from getting any ideas."
 austria.4.a:0 "We can count on them."

 austria.5.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Protect Us"
 austria.5.d:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] has flat out refused to protect us against the Germans. It appears as if their desire for an alliance with them outweighs their current alliance with us."
 austria.5.a:0 "We are alone. God help us."
 austria.5.b:0 "We must find other options." 

 austria.6.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Requests Protection"
 austria.6.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has come to us regarding the recent German remilitarization of the Rhineland. The [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership believe that after the Germans showed their blatant disregard for the Treaty of Versailles, it is only a matter of time before they try to integrate Austria into their realm, and as such they come to us looking for protection. As our goal is to keep Germany weak, this might be worth considering, although we should probably demand reforms to their government and the eventual restoration of free elections if they are to be protected by us."
 austria.6.a:0 "We will do it, but they must reform."
 austria.6.b:0 "This is not in our interests."

 austria.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Democratic Reforms"
 austria.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has expressed that [FROM.GetNameDef] is open to protecting us, however they demand in return that we must remove our restrictions on opposition parties and move towards holding free elections in the future. This demand has been deemed ridiculous by many members of the government, however, many see this alliance as our only chance to be protected by Germany.\n\With the country divided by this choice, Schuschnigg himself has floated the idea of proposing a moderate restoration of Otto Von Hapsburg as a unifying figure for the nation in these times, and he believes that the Allies are too desperate to weaken Germany to deny us this request.\n\nWhat will be our choice?"
 austria.7.a:0 "Accept the reforms. It is our only choice."
 austria.7.b:0 "Propose the Hapsburg Plan."
 austria.7.c:0 "No compromises! We will find someone else."

 austria.8.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDef] Accepts Our Demands"
 austria.8.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership has accepted our demands. We will protect them against the Germans, and they will begin democratic reforms. This is a great victory for us, as we have both weakened Germany and brought a new country into our sphere of influence."
 austria.8.a:0 "Very well."
 
 austria.9.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Hapsburg Compromise" 
 austria.9.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has returned to us with a compromise regarding our demands - Otto Von Hapsburg will be restored as a constitutional figurehead of a moderate Austrian Empire. Some members of government think this is ridiculous - we just fought a war against them not 20 years ago, However some believe that letting Austria slip away into Germany's grasp is too big a risk, and we should agree anyway."
 austria.9.a:0 "They can have their restoration."
 austria.9.b:0 "Our demands are clear."

 austria.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Hapsburg Compromise"
 austria.10.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegates have accepted our compromise - Otto Von Hapsburg will be restored as a constitutional figurehead of a moderate Austrian Empire."
 austria.10.a:0 "A great achievement!"
 
 austria.11.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Hapsburg Compromise"
 austria.11.d:0 "[FROM.Adjective] delegates have flatly refused our compromise, citing that they will not support the restoration of the same empire they fought not 20 years ago. They continue to demand we must remove our restrictions on opposition parties and move towards holding free elections in the future."
 austria.11.a:0 "We should accept their demands before it's too late."
 austria.11.b:0 "We're done here. We can find allies elsewhere."

 austria.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Protect Us"
 austria.12.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has flat out refused to protect us against the Germans. Perhaps our differences were too great after all."
 austria.12.a:0 "We must find other options." 

 austria.13.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Requests Negotiations"
 austria.13.d:0 "[AUS.GetLeader] has reached out to our government, claiming that it is increasingly obvious that we wish to incorporate them into our realm, and they wish to negotiate.\n\nThe [AUS.GetAdjective]s have proposed that Austria become an autonomous subject of Germany, and in turn we would not occupy them."
 austria.13.a:0 "We can accept this compromise, but a friendly government must take power."
 austria.13.b:0 "We have other plans for them."
 
 austria.14.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Demands Nazi Takeover"
 austria.14.d:0 "[GER.GetLeader] has agreed to our request to become an autonomous subject, however he demands that we must install a government friendly to the Nazi regime, which would mean the takeover of the Austrian Nazis."
 austria.14.a:0 "Schuschnigg will not give up power so easily, but we can deal with him."
 austria.14.b:0 "Unnaceptable! We will find better allies!"
 
 austria.15.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 austria.15.d:0 "Austrian leadership has contacted us and promised the Schuschnigg will be dealt with as requested."
 austria.15.a:0 "We await to see it."

 austria.16.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 austria.16.d:0 "The Austrian delegates have flat out refused any change of government, and negotiations have collapsed."
 austria.16.a:0 "We will deal with them soon enough."

 austria.17.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Negotiations"
 austria.17.d:0 "Our attempts to negotiate with Germany have been ignored. We can only assume the worst is to come, and we must prepare for it."
 austria.17.a:0 "we must find someone to protect us."

 austria.18.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Recieves Foreign Protection"
 austria.18.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective]s, probably seeing our expansionist policies, have recieved foreign protection against any threats from us. This effectively puts a stop to our plans for an Anschluss, as it is not worth the risk to enter a war with any major countries at this point in time."
 austria.18.a:0 "Scrap our plans for the Anschluss"
