 #FOCUS
 AUS_clock_ticks_down:0 "The Clock Ticks Down"
 AUS_clock_ticks_down_desc:0 "It has begun. The Nazis have marched into the Rhineland, their first official blatant disregardment of the Treaty of Versailles. As this is the treaty that keeps us independent, we must find a way to make the Germans think twice before marching on our border.\n\nTick, Tock." 
 AUS_look_outwards:0 "Looking Outwards"
 AUS_look_outwards_desc:0 "With the treaty of Versailles slowly crumbling, we must look outwards for protection against a resurgent Germany who undoubtedly wishes to unite their nation with ours."
 AUS_look_west:0 "Look to the West"
 AUS_look_west_desc:0 "While we may have good relations with [ITA.GetNameDef], they are beginning to be too friendly with the Nazis, which puts us under risk. Instead, we should be looking westwards towards Britain and France, who we might not agree ideologically with, but they do not want to see Austria united with Germany just as much as we do."
 AUS_ally_italy:0 "Continue the Italian Alliance"
 AUS_ally_italy_desc:0 "The Italian fascists have long proved to be our greatest ally. After aiding us during the brutal July Putsch, we should be able to trust them to protect us against the Nazis."
 AUS_accept_inevitable:0 "Accept the Inevitable"
 AUS_accept_inevitable_desc:0 "It's no use. The western allies will never protect us, and the Italians are too friendly with the Germans to be reliable. We should try to enter negotiations with the Germans, and maybe we can obtain favorable terms."

 AUS_july_followed_june:0 "July Followed June"
 AUS_july_followed_june_desc:0 "One month following Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss's banning of the Austrian Nazi Party on the 19th of June 1934, the Schutzstaffel led a failed putsch against the Vaterlandische Front government. During the bloody coup that was launched on the 25th of July, the entire federal army was mobilized to fight the SS troops, eventually managing to defeat them, however Dollfuss was killed during the fighting, leaving our new regime in a very vulnerable situation.\n\nAfter taking over following Dollfuss's death, Kurt Schuschnigg has avowed to make sure such an event will never happened again, however there are still supporters of the Nazis at large, heavily destabilizing our nation."
 AUS_memories_of_februarkampfe:0 "Memories of Februarkampfe"
 AUS_memories_of_februarkampfe_desc:0 "During the takeover of the Vaterlandische Front, a brief civil war was fought between government forces under Engelbert Dollfuss's fascist regime, and the social democratic Republican Defence League. The federal government eventually succeeded in defeating the republican forces, however scars still remain, and in many major cities there is still sizeable support for the socialist parties."
 AUS_reliant_on_lon:0 "Reliant on League of Nations Loans"
 AUS_reliant_on_lon_desc:0 "Ever since the League of Nations granted us a loan to save our economy in 1922, our nation has been reliant on loans from the international community to keep it afloat. If something were to happen to disturb the international status quo, we would be in deep trouble."
