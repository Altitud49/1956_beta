PER_white_revolution:0 "The Khan'so Revolution"
PER_white_revolution_desc:0 "Iran will not become a global power by the bickering of fools who have no knowledge of how to rule a people, we will not be ruled by the whims of the selfish nor the Mullahs who so desperately cling to power. I will drag Iran into the modern age kicking and screaming if i must."
PER_islam_or_nolam:0 "The Mullahs Place"
PER_islam_or_nolam_desc:0 "The Mullahs have long enjoyed powers that keep them in a class of their own, using their positions to teach the children to trust them first and the state second. No more, I shall take their Koranic Schools and give the children a proper education. Teach them science, not surahs."
PER_foreign_munies:0 "Iran's Global Relations"
PER_foreign_munies_desc:0 "No man is an island, nor a nation alone. If we do not get allies on the global stage soon, we will be left in the dust to be eaten by the vultures around us. We must grasp onto one of the mighty, and hold on for dear life. For if we do not, then soon we will become nothing more than a marionette on strings."
PER_ethnic_tensions:0 "The Ethnic Boiling Point"
PER_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "For centuries now the ethnicities within Iran have been agitating for increased autonomy, for a national self-determination of their own, to rule themselves instead of being under the Shah's rule. Finally these questions have reached a boiling point, and now we must answer their call."
PER_kurdish_question:0 "The Kurdish Question"
PER_kurdish_question_desc:0 "The Kurds are the most vocal of all the minorities within Iran, their clans united under the one goal of a nation for the Kurds to call home, strewn across Mesopotamia, Turkey and Iran their calls have always fallen upon deaf ears. Will this ever change?"
PER_anglo_oil_company:0 "Is It Ours, Or Theirs"
PER_anglo_oil_company_desc:0 "The oil in Iran has ever since the time of the last Qajar Shah, been in the dominion of the British, plundering our nation of its resources for all its worth, for nothing in return but a small payment and a pat on the back. The rage and anger from this arrangement is almost at a boiling point, with many within the nation agitating for change."
PER_hijab_bad:0 "Kashf-e Hijab"
PER_hijab_bad_desc:0 "The hijab is nothing more than a regressive tool used by the mullahs to keep women down, to move Iran into the future so too must we agitate for the equality of woman to man. What use is keeping half the population in the kitchen, when a woman can make a rifle just as good as a man can?"
PER_shah_favorite:0 "The Khan's Favorite"
PER_shah_favorite_desc:0 "Through Reza's journey he has found many questions, and equally as many answers. But now it's time to answer the greatest question of them all, what nation is his favorite? Who will in the end be the ally that Iran joins itself to. The reds in the north, the Brits in the east, or the Krauts of the west?"

PER_banking:0 "Iranian Foreign Relations"
PER_banking_desc:0 "Iran in its strategical position has always had to struggle against the might of the empires surronding it, whether it be the Russians from the north, the British from the east or the Ottomans from the west. Iran is not new to the game of global powers, and so it has learned to play it well.\n\nFor now the relations we have with the USSR are [?per_alignment_rus|=+0]\n\nRelations with the British are [?per_alignment_bri|=+0]\n\nAnd our relations with the Germans are [?per_alignment_ger|=+0]"
PER_hitler_gunnies:0 "German Rifles"
PER_hitler_gunnies_desc:0 "As Germany arms itself for a blitz across Europe, we ourselves require arms to prepare for any wars that may fall upon us. For this, we require guns. And to get guns? We require factories, yet we lack factories! What are we to do? Well as the Shah always says, "We may lack guns, we may lack factories, but we do not lack friends. So let's work with what we have, aye?" "
PER_jewish_science_people:0 "Jewish Scientists"
PER_jewish_science_people_desc:0 "The Jews are a clever people, running from the reich as it keeps threatening to kill them all. Off they scamper to America, Britain and anywhere else that will take them. But the Shah has a new idea, what if they were paid to come here to Iran? While this might anger the Germans this is nothing some pandering can't fix."

PER_gimme_your_babies_khan:0 "The Great Khan"
PER_gimme_your_babies_khan_desc:0 "The Great Khan rules from his throne in Sa’dābād, keeping a watchful eye over his people and keeping the nation running forwards towards a brighter future. The people love him, the army adores him, what more could one ask for? A leader wise beyond his years and with a great dream. While the Turks may enjoy holding Constantinople, and the Italians holding Rome, we have something none of them have. Persepolis and an empire of not kings nor emperors, but the kings of kings! May the shahanshah live forever!"
PER_anglo_iranian_oil_company:0 "The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company"
PER_anglo_iranian_oil_company_desc:0 "Ever since the discovery of oil in Iran, other nations have been using our supply and given us barely anything in return. While we may enjoy some of the tiny spoils, the empires that abuse us get to enjoy the rest of the pie. This has been the ball and chain keeping Iran down for half a century now, may it soon be dealt with."
PER_bad_construction:0 "Backwards Construction Techniques"
PER_bad_construction_desc:0 "Iran's construction has become backwards compared to the modern nations of Europe and America, weaker than the rest, without efficiency nor speed. Keeping us behind and making sure that we cannot modernize, an irredeemable thorn in our side."

perstate.1.t:0 "The White Revolution Begins"
perstate.1.d:0 "All across Iran cars with loudspeakers on their backs broadcast the Khan's new message, a message of progress, of prosperity, as transcripts arrive to archives and newspapers we have now gotten access to the speech. From what we have gotten from the archives, the speech goes like this:\n\n "As modernity reaches the world, it has left us on our own. As the nations of the world move forwards to the future, with industrialization galore and factories to and fro, we are left here alone. Our rich nation set back by the backwards ways of our past, to become better, we have to lose the shackles holding us down. The need for real education, the need for better work, the need for a better life for all that live in our great nation of Iran! Wake, oh slumbering giant, wake oh, lost beast! May the fires and flames of our factory lines and refineries purify us, improve us, let the factories roar as the tanks of war move forwards, let our people wake from their long slumber, their long fall into decadence and weakness. Take off your silk slippers and put on your boots, all of us in this nation have our work cut out for us, but under my watchful eye we shall all move to the future at not a crawl, nor a walk, but a headlong sprint!""
perstate.1.a:0 "Long live the king of kings!"
