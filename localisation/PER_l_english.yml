PER_white_revolution:0 "The Khan's Revolution"
PER_white_revolution_desc:0 "Iran will not become a global power by the bickering of fools who have no knowledge of how to rule a people, we will not be ruled by the whims of the selfish nor the Mullahs who so desperately cling to power. I will drag Iran into the modern age kicking and screaming if i must."
PER_islam_or_nolam:0 "The Mullahs Place"
PER_islam_or_nolam_desc:0 "The Mullahs have long enjoyed powers that keep them in a class of their own, using their positions to teach the children to trust them first and the state second. No more, I shall take their Koranic Schools and give the children a proper education. Teach them science, not surahs."
PER_foreign_munies:0 "Iran's Global Relations"
PER_foreign_munies_desc:0 "No man is an island, nor a nation alone. If we do not get allies on the global stage soon we will be left in the dust to be eaten by the vultures around us. We must grasp onto one of the mighty and hold on for dear life. For if we do not then soon we will become nothing more than a marionette on strings. "
PER_ethnic_tensions:0 "The Ethnic Boiling Point"
PER_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "For centuries now the ethnicities within Iran have been agitating for increased autonomy, for a national self-determination of their own, to rule themselves instead of being under the Shah's rule. Finally these questions have reached a boiling point, and now we must answer their call."
PER_kurdish_question:0 "The Kurdish Question"
PER_kurdish_question_desc:0 "The Kurds are the most vocal of all the minorities within Iran, their clans united under the one goal of a nation for the Kurds to call home, strewn across Mesopotamia Turkey and Iran their calls have always fallen on deaf ears. Will this ever change?"
PER_anglo_oil_company:0 "Is It Ours, Or Theirs"
PER_anglo_oil_company_desc:0 "The oil in Iran has ever since the time of the last Qajar shah been in the dominion of the British, plundering our nation of its resources for all its worth for nothing in return but a small payment and a pat on the back. The rage and anger about this arrangement is almost at a boiling point, with many within the nation agitating for change."
PER_hijab_bad:0 "Kashf-e Hijab"
PER_hijab_bad_desc:0 "The hijab is nothing but a regressive tool used by the mullahs to keep women down, to move Iran into the future so too must we agitate for the equality of woman to man. What use is keeping half the population in the kitchen, when a woman can make a rifle just as good as a man can?"
PER_shah_favorite:0 "The Khan's Favorite"
PER_shah_favorite_desc:0 "Through Reza's journey he has found many questions, and equally as many answers. But now it's time to answer the greatest question of them all, what nation is his favorite? Who will in the end be the ally that Iran attaches itself to the hip of. The reds in the north, the Brits in the east, or the Krauts of the west?"

PER_banking:0 "Iranian Foreign Relations"
PER_banking_desc:0 "Iran in its strategical position has always had to struggle against the might of the empires surronding it, whether it be the Russians from the north, the British from the east or the Ottomans from the west. Iran is not new to the game of global powers, and so it has learned to play it well.\n\nFor now the relations we have with the USSR are [?per_alignment_rus|=+]\n\nRelations with the British are [?per_alignment_bri|=+]\n\nAnd our relations with the Germans are [?per_alignment_ger|=+]"
