 erwache.1.t:0 "Appointing Economic Positions"
 erwache.1.d:0 "We have two appointment options for the offices of Reichsbank President and Economic Minister. One of the possible appointees, Hjalmar Schacht, is very good at working with Germany's companies and developing civilain infrastructure, but his lack of loyalty to the NSDAP and distain for military spending make him a worrying choice. Our second possible appointee, Walther Funk, is very loyal to the NSDAP and is a major proponent of military spending. If we are to make any good progress with German recovery, we must choose one of these two men to lead our economy."

 erwache.1.b:0 "Walther Funk"
 erwache.2.t:0 "The Problem of the Steelworks"
 erwache.2.d:0 "As the German military grows, we must ensure that we have a secure and stable source of steel. Our current primary steel producer, Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, has been a valuable ally in the NSDAP's rise to power and is a major employer of German workers. But, the Stahlwerke hasn't been yielding as much steel as it could be; forming and supporting Reichswerke Hermann Göring instead may yield a significantly larger amount of steel and support the German war effort more effectively."

 erwache.4.t:0 "The Fall of the Nazis"
 erwache.4.d:0 "After the rapid rise of monarchists and other pro-Kaiser parties, the NSDAP has found no alternatives but to surrender control of the German government. This historic decision is being officially declared in the German Reichstag, but it is still unknown who will reign as the Kaiser of the new Fourth Reich. We can either call upon Wilhelm the Second, the ruler of the Second Reich during the Great War, or Prince Wilhelm the Third, son of Wilhelm the Second and a man very much capable of holding this historic position."

 erwache.4.b:0 "Prince Wilhelm III will lead us"
 erwache.5.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 erwache.5.d:0 "Monarchists led a sucessful coup against the NSDAP, storming the Reichstag and taking over the government. In the ashes of the burned-down Reichstag, former Chancellor Adolf Hitler lays dead, leaving Heinrich Himmler as the new head of government stationed in Munich. Himmler and the remaining Nazi loyalists have started a civil war against our new imperial government, and we must fight to reunify Germany. Who will lead us on our path to the unified Fourth Riech: former Kaiser Wilhelm II or his son, Prince Wilhelm III?"

Hitler stopped bodyguards before revealing that he was the Kung Führer and that he knew that a Kung Fu master would one day try to challenge him. The mysterious man presented himself as Brandson Lee before attacking the German Chancellor with the wrath of a tiger. The duel lasted multiple minutes. The hits where apparently so quick that it was difficult to follow the action, but suddenly the intruder planted his hand into the Führer's chest. The Führer let out a single gasp before collapsing to the ground. The SS then fired at the assassin, but he managed to dodge multiple bullets and stop others with his bare hands before escaping through a side door, chopping multiple sentries in the process."
